Project 3: From Porland to Portland

This project is a website that shows you (the audience) different parts of the USA, a road trip if you will.

I constructed the site using HTML and CSS. I was able to integrate my new knowledge of flex-grid and media queries.

Here is a link to the project: https://jajjer.github.io/web_project_3/#
